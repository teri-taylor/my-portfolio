                    <!-- Brief bio about your background -->
                    <p class="background-content">My name is Teri'Ana Taylor. I was born in Tennessee 
                    and raised in Georgia. I have nine siblings, six sisters and three brothers. I am currently pursuing a
                    major in Software Engineering and a minor in Information Technology. Previously,
                    I was a biology major at Augusta University. For years, I rode the line between 
                    Architectural Engineering and Medicine, then, in my sophomore year I changed paths to
                    Software Engineering. I was completely new to coding and immediately felt extremely 
                    behind. But now, I've come to really enjoy coding and can't wait for my future career! </p>

                    <!-- List of skills and experience -->
                    <h3>Experience</h3>
                    <p>Through class projects and personal practice, I have gained experience with these skills: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
                        <li>Wireframing</li>
                    </ul>

                    


                    <br>

                    <!-- Explanation of personal goals -->
                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>By the end of this year, I hope to complete my personal project. I also want to better my Java and flexbox skills. 
                        I want to better these skills so that I am able to get an internship in software engineering, which is another
                        one of my goals. In the long term, I want to secure a role at a tech company or startup where I can apply my skills.
